Key Discussion: Ramon's Agency Framework
Central Question: What Constitutes Agency Beyond Human-Centered Models?
The Artifactual vs. Artificial Distinction:

Artifactual: Objects with genuine agency and "thing knowledge" (Davis Baird's concept)
Artificial: Fake, simulated, imitative, counterfeit representations
Core Issue: We've lost connection to real artifacts that possess their own forms of agency
Challenging Anthropocentric Agency:

Traditional view: Humans as pinnacle of agency (Kantian: free + autonomous + authentic = agency)
Problem: Even when we acknowledge non-human agency (like dogs), we frame it as "lesser" or derivative of human agency
Question: How do we recognize genuinely different forms of agency rather than anthropomorphic projections?
Practical Implications:

Linguistic Challenge: Do we need new vocabulary to discuss non-anthropocentric agency?
Perceptual Challenge: How do we learn to see agency differently?
Temporal Challenge: What role does time play in recognizing different agencies?
Cross-Disciplinary Tensions:

Designers focus on artifacts
Philosophers focus on people
Gap: How do machines potentially shield humans from accountability?
Key Insights from Discussion:
De-anthropomorphization Possibilities:

Historical precedent: We successfully de-anthropomorphized clocks (moved from seeing them as divine creations to mechanical tools)
Cultural variation: Western vs. Japanese/Shinto perspectives on object agency
Agency Without Consciousness:

Forests demonstrate cognitive processes without consciousness
Agency doesn't require free will or consciousness
Foundation models as "gear" - adaptable tools with specific artifactual properties
Epistemic Technology:

Photography as knowledge-producing technology
Stable Diffusion as artifact: useful in cancer research, more problematic in generative AI applications
Function defines artifactual status: intended purpose distinguishes artifacts from natural objects
Questions for Further Exploration:
Methodological: How can we develop research methods that recognize non-anthropocentric agency?
Practical: What metaphors (anthropologist? alien?) help us engage with genuinely different forms of agency?
Ethical: How do we maintain accountability while acknowledging machine agency?
Interdisciplinary: How can we bridge the artifact-focus of design with the people-focus of philosophy?
Note: Some passages in the original notes were unclear - particularly around specific technical details and some participant connections. The core themes around agency, artifactual vs. artificial distinctions, and interdisciplinary approaches to AI research came through clearly and seem central to the group's shared interests.

session with ada - the main focus is what surprised you when you created your own agent magda - more interested on an agent that I have created - very nice and indepth answers that i really like - did you track the influence of your prompt? yes because i cross-checked - felt the prompt was coming from there yash - the more time you give it the more nuance - interesting how they ask me many questions is it annotying that it ask you many questions? very straight forward - aaahhh how many more questions... but then you appreciate it once is done "it should force you to evaluate and be critical" interesting functionality - what if I want to share that agent - hiring a freelancer - specialized consultants - we are calling them proto agents - agentic ai - are they really agents? what is the difference between a function in a script and an agent? yeah but tools using other tools - terms are important - how do we call things is a hotly discussed topic - this tool is used within a university project and we call it agent -

the interesting discussion is how do we call these things - persona? agent? simulations? sometimes it is good to be flexible - terminology is a minefield - how do we want to call this practices?

focusing on prompting is focusing on the practice, rather than the object -

terms are moving so fast too (this is super interesting) what we called agent when we made ADA is not the same as it is today, and we are a different team - it is not only the code that needs to be updated, but the terms we use! when ADA was made, the term agent was used and then the term changed but it hasnt been updated (mind blowing, please remember)

something about how ADA lovelace was transcribing the notes of charles babbage (like this agent now - also mindblowing, please remember)

tokens are not information but we manipulate knowledge - lenka how to connect different modalities - embodied practices to understand what a token is - it is like a pixel in an image - no it is not - tokens emerge from data, they are arbitrary - pixels are different, we have more agency over pixels, than over tokens.

Session Notes: ADA Agent Creation & Terminology Evolution
Core Focus: What Surprised You When Creating Your Own Agent?
User Experiences with Custom Agents:
Magda's Experience:

Created an agent that provided "very nice and in-depth answers" that she genuinely appreciated
Key Practice: Cross-checked responses to track prompt influence
Could clearly identify when responses originated from her specific prompting approach
Insight: The connection between prompt design and output quality was trackable and meaningful
Yash's Discovery:

Time Investment Principle: "The more time you give it, the more nuance" emerges
Question Dynamics: Agent asked extensive clarifying questions
Initial Reaction: Frustration ("aaahhh how many more questions...")
Eventual Appreciation: Recognized value once process completed
Meta-Insight: "It should force you to evaluate and be critical"
Emerging Functionality Questions:
Sharing Capability: "What if I want to share that agent?"
Professional Analogy: Like hiring a freelancer or specialized consultant
Working Term: "Proto-agents" for these specialized AI tools
Critical Terminology Discussion
The Agency Question:
Core Debate: Are these actually "agents" or sophisticated functions?

Agentic AI vs. traditional scripted functions
Tool-Using Tools: When tools employ other tools, do they become agents?
Context Matters: University project context influences how we label these systems
Terminology as Moving Target:
Rapid Evolution Problem:

Terms change faster than systems can be updated
ADA Example: What was called "agent" during ADA's creation differs from current usage
Team Evolution: Different teams use terms differently over time
Update Challenge: Code updates are easier than terminology updates
Flexible Naming Strategy:

Options: Persona? Agent? Simulation?
Approach: Sometimes flexibility in terminology is beneficial
Caution: "Terminology is a minefield"
Practice vs. Object Focus:
Key Insight: Focusing on "prompting" emphasizes the practice rather than the object

Shifts attention from what the thing is to what people do with it
Highlights human agency in the interaction
Recognizes the collaborative nature of AI engagement
Historical & Technical Parallels
ADA Lovelace Connection:
Historical Echo: Current ADA agent transcribing/transforming notes parallels Ada Lovelace transcribing Charles Babbage's work

Then: Human mathematician translating mechanical concepts
Now: AI agent translating human thoughts into structured content
Continuity: The practice of interpretive transcription across technological eras
Token vs. Pixel Analysis:
Lenka's Modality Question: How to connect different modalities through embodied practices?

Token Characteristics:

Not Information: Tokens manipulate knowledge but aren't information themselves
Emergence: Tokens emerge from data in arbitrary ways
Limited Agency: We have less control over tokens than over pixels
Pixel Comparison:

Visual Control: More direct human agency over pixel manipulation
Different Nature: Pixels and tokens operate through fundamentally different principles
Agency Gradient: Spectrum of human control across different digital elements
Key Insights for Further Development:
Process Insights:
Time-Nuance Relationship: Longer engagement produces more sophisticated outputs
Question-Value Paradox: Initial frustration with agent questions leads to eventual appreciation
Critical Thinking Catalyst: Well-designed agents should force user evaluation and critical thinking
Terminology Management:
Evolution Tracking: Need systems to update terminology as fields evolve
Context Sensitivity: Same technology may need different terms in different contexts
Practice-Centered Language: Focus on what people do rather than what things are
Technical Understanding:
Agency Spectrum: From scripted functions to tool-using tools to proto-agents
Control Gradients: Different levels of human agency across different digital elements
Historical Continuity: Current AI practices echo historical human-machine collaboration patterns
Note: The discussion reveals fascinating tensions between rapid technological development and the slower evolution of language and conceptual frameworks. The ADA Lovelace parallel is particularly striking - suggesting these collaborative human-AI practices have deeper historical roots than we might initially recognize.

Chromatographic patterns as soil's "voice" made visible
Chemical processes as soil's way of expressing its composition, health, history
Analog visualization as translation medium between soil chemistry and human perception
Speculative Communication:

What if soil chromatograms are not just data about soil, but soil's own form of expression?
What if we approach chromatography as conversation rather than analysis?
What if the aesthetic qualities of chromatograms carry meaning beyond scientific measurement?
Interspecies Dialogue:

Human-soil collaboration through chromatographic process
Soil as co-researcher rather than research object
Chromatographic patterns as shared language between human and more-than-human worlds
Practical Implications:
