# Table 4.1. Description of chromatogram features and parameters measured to quantify variability among chromatograms.

| Feature | Parameters measured | What it represents | Abbreviation |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Central | Central Zone radius (mm) | Patterns in the central zone inform about the presence of minerals. These are the heaviest contents of the digest to move into the filter paper and are thus move the least distance from the centre of the filter paper. | CZ |
| Median | Median Zone radius (mm) | Structure indicates the presence of proteins, organic carbon and organic matter (minerals and humus). | MZ |
| Outer | Outer Zone radius (mm) | "Clouds" at the ends of spikes indicate available nutrients. Bacterial enzyme activity displayed in this zone. | |
| Total | Total radius (mm) | | TR |
| Combinations | Median + Outer Zone radius (mm) | | MZ+OZ |
| | Central Zone radius: Median + Outer Zone radius | | CZ:MZ+OZ |
| Channels | Channels (1=absent, 5=fully developed) | Greater number of channels suggests increased organic matter and nutrients. Channels extending across zones indicate integration of soil components. | Channels |
| # channels | Number of channels in quadrant | | # channels |
| Spikes | Spikes (1=absent, 5=fully developed) | Greater number of spikes suggests increased organic matter and nutrients. Well-developed spikes are thought to represent healthy soil. | Spikes |
| # spikes | Number of spikes in quadrant | | # spikes |
| Colour | Colour intensity (1=blurred, 5=intense) | Warm colours (gold, red, yellow, orange, cream) and/or high colour intensity indicate healthy soil. Colder colours (grey, dark brown, or blueish) suggest soils with less microbial activity. | Colour |
| Rings | Number of concentric rings | Strong rings indicate possible excess of soluble minerals | Rings |
