PermaPrompting with Feral (AI)gents

AI prompting—the act of shaping how AI systems like ChatGPT generate content—is becoming a widespread everyday practice for creativity and connection, but also control, exclusion, manipulation and environmental devastation. In light of the disruptive presence of AI tools, how do we build literacy around their inner workings and develop collective strategies that challenge proprietary infrastructures?

Machine learning use, transform or refuse? 

Co-organised by the Ars Biologica Independent Study Program (ABIS) of the Budweis – European Capital of Culture 2028, the Doctoral Research Department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague (AVU), and the Uroboros collective, this 4-day summer school invites artists, designers, researchers, and students of varied backgrounds to experiment with co-creative approaches to prompting and building AI agents. Taking permaculture principles as a critical and generative framework, we will explore whether everyday human–AI interactions can be reimagined through the lenses of interdependence and contextual sensitivity, rather than individual productivity and scale.

Guided by an interdisciplinary group of tutors from different parts of the world, participants will work with their preferred AI data-materials (see Application Guidelines below) and co-create custom feral AI agents–algorithmic entities operating at the edges of utility to explore meanings emerging through spontaneous yet careful engagements with diverse (more-than)human contexts and data.
