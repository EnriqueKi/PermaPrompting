Permaprompting Summer School: Project Presentations Summary
Project 1: Pollinator Garden Simulation Game
Core Concept: AI-Powered Ecological Gaming
Historical Integration + Modern Technology:
•	Medieval Plant Knowledge: Using historical data about plants used for disease treatment in Middle Ages
•	AI Plant Recognition: Artificial intelligence system to identify old/historical plants
•	Pollinator Attractiveness Calculation: AI calculates which plants are most attractive to pollinators
Interactive Gameplay Mechanics:
Visual & Audio Feedback System:
•	Dynamic Plant Movement: Play-dots and leaves move around plants based on attractiveness calculations
•	Pollinator Behavior: Bees and other pollinators choose plants based on AI calculations
•	Population Dynamics: Number of pollinators increases when they like planted species
•	Musical Integration: Volume of soundtrack increases with pollinator population
•	Harmony Concept: Creating "symphony between us and them" through conscious planting choices
Educational Goals:
Consciousness Raising:
•	Beyond Aesthetics: Moving from planting "pretty" things to considering broader ecological benefits
•	Systemic Thinking: Understanding impact on larger biotopes and ecosystems
•	Pollinator-Centered Design: Prioritizing pollinator needs over human preferences
Technical Implementation:
Data Structure:
•	JSON Plant Descriptions: Each plant has attributes including water accumulation, insect effectiveness, etc.
•	Comprehensive Database: Rich information source driving all calculations and interactions
•	Agent Potential: Could develop into gardening advisor agent for pollinator-friendly garden design
Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented):
•	Invasive Species Management: Originally planned to include invasive species removal gameplay
•	Varied Environments: Different soil topographies and plant size options
•	Educational Applications: Suitable for scratch programming and children's education
Development Challenges:
•	Complexity: Invasive species feature proved too complicated and time-consuming
•	Scope Management: Focused on core concept rather than expanding features
•	Sound Design: Evolved from "dramatic" Bumblebee music to more "romantic" soundtrack
 
Project 2: Invasive Species Cultural Integration Through Prague Legends
Conceptual Framework: Cultural Naturalization
Core Research Question:
•	Temporal Integration: How many generations needed for invasive species to become "citizens"?
•	Cultural Acceptance: How can invasive species be integrated into local culture?
•	Historical Precedent: When do invasive species become accepted as "domestic"?
Methodology: AI-Powered Legend Creation
Data Sources:
•	Invasive Species Database: Scientific information about non-native species in Prague area
•	Prague Legends Database: Historical stories and folklore from Prague's cultural heritage
AI Process (Using Claude):
1.	Species Research: AI analyzes invasive species characteristics and habitat information
2.	Legend Matching: AI identifies most suitable traditional legends for blending
3.	Story Generation: Creates new hybrid legends integrating invasive species into cultural narratives
4.	Storyboard Creation: Visual planning for video production
Production Pipeline:
Multi-Modal Output:
•	Story Generation: Claude creates hybrid legends
•	Visual Production: Sora generates video content (with mixed results)
•	Audio Integration: Text-to-speech narration of legends
•	Video Editing: Combining all elements into final presentations
Sample Output: "The 14 Healing Spires" Legend
Narrative Structure:
•	Historical Setting: Medieval Prague monastery with failing medicinal gardens
•	Divine Intervention: Vision of 14 towering flower spires sent from "lands beyond great waters"
•	Miraculous Healing: Foreign seeds (invasive species) restore soil fertility and garden productivity
•	Unintended Consequences: Plants spread beyond control, disrupting native ecosystems
•	Wisdom Integration: Understanding that "powerful gifts carry greatest responsibility"
Cultural Integration Elements:
•	Religious Framework: Integration with 14 Holy Helpers Catholic tradition
•	Local Geography: Specific Prague locations (St. Stephen's Church, monastery gardens)
•	Ecological Realism: Accurate description of invasive species characteristics (nitrogen-fixing, rapid spread)
•	Contemporary Connection: Modern scientific names alongside traditional "healing spires" designation
Technical Challenges & Limitations:
AI Generation Issues:
•	Visual Quality: Sora-generated videos described as "terrible" and "awful"
•	Limited Control: Automated process provided no intervention opportunities
•	Time Constraints: Insufficient time for prompt refinement and iteration
•	Creator Frustration: Difficulty accepting lack of control over visual outcomes
Process Insights:
•	Story Quality: Text generation (Claude) produced "quite good" narratives without adjustment
•	Visual Limitations: Video generation requires more time and prompt engineering
•	Automation Trade-offs: Fully automated agent approach sacrifices quality control
Project Outcomes:
Completed Elements:
•	Three Stories: Multiple invasive species integrated into Prague legends (one fish, two plants)
•	Cultural Framework: Method for naturalizing invasive species through storytelling
•	Process Documentation: Clear pipeline for AI-assisted cultural integration
Unrealized Potential:
•	Interactive Agent: Originally planned comprehensive agent for location-based species recommendations
•	Quality Refinement: Visual outputs need significant improvement for public presentation
•	Expanded Coverage: More species and legends could be integrated with additional time
 
Cross-Project Themes & Insights:
AI as Cultural Mediator:
•	Both projects use AI to bridge different knowledge systems (historical/contemporary, scientific/cultural)
•	Technology serves educational and consciousness-raising goals rather than purely technical objectives
•	AI enables new forms of storytelling and ecological awareness
Ecological Consciousness Through Technology:
•	Project 1: Gaming mechanics promote pollinator-centered thinking
•	Project 2: Storytelling creates cultural space for accepting ecological complexity
•	Both challenge anthropocentric approaches to environmental management
Process vs. Product Tensions:
•	Both projects encountered challenges balancing automated AI processes with creative control
•	Quality concerns when fully automating creative outputs
•	Need for human intervention and refinement in AI-assisted creative work
Educational Applications:
•	Strong potential for both projects in educational contexts
•	Interactive elements engage users in ecological thinking
•	Cultural integration makes environmental concepts more accessible and memorable
These presentations demonstrate innovative approaches to using AI for ecological education and cultural integration, while also revealing important limitations and challenges in current AI-assisted creative processes.
