Key Discussion: Ramon's Agency Framework
Central Question: What Constitutes Agency Beyond Human-Centered Models?
The Artifactual vs. Artificial Distinction:

Artifactual: Objects with genuine agency and "thing knowledge" (Davis Baird's concept)
Artificial: Fake, simulated, imitative, counterfeit representations
Core Issue: We've lost connection to real artifacts that possess their own forms of agency
Challenging Anthropocentric Agency:

Traditional view: Humans as pinnacle of agency (Kantian: free + autonomous + authentic = agency)
Problem: Even when we acknowledge non-human agency (like dogs), we frame it as "lesser" or derivative of human agency
Question: How do we recognize genuinely different forms of agency rather than anthropomorphic projections?
Practical Implications:

Linguistic Challenge: Do we need new vocabulary to discuss non-anthropocentric agency?
Perceptual Challenge: How do we learn to see agency differently?
Temporal Challenge: What role does time play in recognizing different agencies?
Cross-Disciplinary Tensions:

Designers focus on artifacts
Philosophers focus on people
Gap: How do machines potentially shield humans from accountability?
Key Insights from Discussion:
De-anthropomorphization Possibilities:

Historical precedent: We successfully de-anthropomorphized clocks (moved from seeing them as divine creations to mechanical tools)
Cultural variation: Western vs. Japanese/Shinto perspectives on object agency
Agency Without Consciousness:

Forests demonstrate cognitive processes without consciousness
Agency doesn't require free will or consciousness
Foundation models as "gear" - adaptable tools with specific artifactual properties
Epistemic Technology:

Photography as knowledge-producing technology
Stable Diffusion as artifact: useful in cancer research, more problematic in generative AI applications
Function defines artifactual status: intended purpose distinguishes artifacts from natural objects
Questions for Further Exploration:
Methodological: How can we develop research methods that recognize non-anthropocentric agency?
Practical: What metaphors (anthropologist? alien?) help us engage with genuinely different forms of agency?
Ethical: How do we maintain accountability while acknowledging machine agency?
Interdisciplinary: How can we bridge the artifact-focus of design with the people-focus of philosophy?
